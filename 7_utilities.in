.h2 Mkinheader

Mkinheader makes header/index file for in3. It parses all the .in files
and creates, depending on the flags, an index or header.

	 --help	This help
	 -h  --header	create an includable header
	 -i  --index	create an index-file
	 -t	Don't include the total
	 -v	increase verbosity

An index file is a .in-format file; the header is an HTML-part file, which can be included 
in a real HTML file.

There are two files that can be used to modify the resulting index-file:

- index.top: this file is placed before the generated output
- index.bottom: this file is placed below the generated output

Both files are copied literally to the output.


.h2 Mk_cover

If a file
.fix coverimage.png
exists,
.fix mk_cover
will create a standardized cover page. The cover page is
placed in
.fix cover.png.
