.h1 Stylesheets

In3 supports stylesheets per output-type. 
It is also possible to put some information in 
.fix meta.in.

.h2 Meta.in
The goal of
.fix meta.in
is to provide meta-information about the text. It is not meant to generate output.
In a 
.fix meta.in
you generally provide information like:

	title	The title of the complete document
	subtitle	The subtitle of the complete document
	author	The author
	cover	The image that should be on the cover. Using an image that is 1200x1600 gives the best results.


.h2 HTML style sheet

If a
.fix stylesheet.css
exists in the current directory, it is called in the HTML code. You can 
create styles for all the normal HTML elements.
Example:
.p
.pre
table.normal {
   border: 1px solid #ddd;
}
.pre
.p
In addition, 
.fix in3html
creates div-containers for specific text-elements:
.p

	class/style	text element	example
	alinea	standard alinea	·alinea { background-color: #DDDD00; }
	alinea<font>	alinea with a specific font	·alineacourier { font-family: "Courier New", Courier; }
	fixed	font for fixed character-width	·fixed { font-family:courier, "courier new", monospace; }
	cel	cell in a normal table	·cel { background-color: #DD00DD; }
	left	left notes	·left { font-size: 80%; }
	list	format for all lists	·list { background-color: #00DDDD; }
	side	side notes (right hand side)	·side { font-size: 50%; background-color: #DD0000; }
	table·note	the layout of notes; mostly used to align notes	table·note td { vertical-allign: top; }
	toc	Table of contents	·toc { color: #000000; background-color: #DDDDDD; width: 100%; } 

For class blocks, a specific class is created, with the name of the block. These can
be used in the css sheet, for example:

.pre
 div.classtest {
    color: #BB0000;
 }
.pre

with a block definition of

.pre
 .block classtest
 this is in the block
 .block
.pre

will produce:

.block classtest
this is in the block
.block

.h2 Groff style sheet

Example:
.p
.pre
 .ds Licon "Table of Contents"
 .nr Ej 1
 .ds HF  HB HB HI HI I I I
 .ds HP  16 12 12  0 0 0 0
 .nr Hb 4
 .nr Hs 1
 .nr Hps 0
 .ds pg*header ''- \\nP -''
.pre
.p

The stylesheet for groff, which is called
.fix stylesheet.mm,
because I used mm before I started tinkering with the groff macro's, can be used to change
the appearance of the pdf-files. Most of the information is the same as for the mm macro set.
Note that in3 does not (yet) support all the possibilities that an mm document has. Currently
supported is:

	 .ds licon txt	Use txt as the header of the table of contents.
	 .nr Ej n	Eject a page before a header at level n
	 .ds HF l1 l2 ...	Define the header font for level l1, l2, ... Use either numerical font or by groff abbreviation
	 .ds HP l1 l2 ...	Define the header pitch size for level l1, l2, ... 0 is the same size as normal text.
	 .nr Hb n	Heading break level
	 .nr Hc n	Heading center level
	 .nr Hs n	Heading style; 0-> 1.1.1... , 1-> single
	 .ds pg*header ''text''	Use text as page header

Fonts can be loaded at positions to change the appearance of the document. 
The font number can also be used the
.fix HF
definition of header-fonts. The following fonts are default:

	Nr	Font	Used for
	1	Times	normal text, lists etc. Also for underlined text
	2	Times Italic	Italic text
	3	Times Bold	Bold text
	4	Times Bold Italic	Bold italic text
	6	Courier	fixed fonts

In addition, in3 will download the font SFOR to provide russian characters. The font is loaded
and referenced by name, never by number.

For class blocks, defined with
.fix block classxxx,
an environment can be created wth the class name. Within the environment, all things
may be changed. AT the end of the block, the environment will be popped off the stack. 
Because classes are implemented as environments, all class blocks will produce a line
break in the pdf output.
An example of the class block:

.pre
 .ev classtest
 .gcolor red
 .ev
.pre
