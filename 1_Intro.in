.h2 My personal itch

Writing this kind of software is considered as "scratching your personal itch".
My personal itches for this project were twofold.

First, I needed something that produces consistent results for both PDF and 
HTML without too much manual intervention. Libreoffice does this, but delivered
just not exactly the type of webpages that I wanted. Dumping webpages to PDF
consistenly gave half lines on the bottom and top. Groff's webpages are just
not good enough for me.

Secondly, I needed something that allows me to have notes in the right margin
of the text.
.side Like this
This is something that you commonly see in school books. I did not
find anything that could do that in an easy way. Publishing software require
too many mouse cliicks to get the work done.


And, of course MY MOUSETRAP IS BETTER!!!

.h2 Downloading
At this moment, there is not a neatly packaged 
in3. You can download the code from github
.link https://github.com/ljmdullaart/in3
or do 
.fix git clone https://github.com/ljmdullaart/in3.git
to get a clone of the sourcecode.


.h2 History
In was a run-off format for web-pages. It was meant to create web pages 
of different formats. It worked quite well as long as the text was kept simple.

At some point, formatting requirements elaborate, using side-notes, tables and left-notes.
There was also the requirement of getting a PDF document, which was produced using tbl
and groff. I called this in2, having the nice pun in2html, in2groff etc.

By now, the code got quite complex. The difference between tables in html and tables in 
tbl made it necessary to dupplicate a lot of code. Adding features became quite a 
challenge.

I also picked up a book called 'Clean Code' by Robert Martin. That described 
exactly the problem I was having; dirty code. 

So a major rewrite became necessary. And it also became necessary to create a
sort of architecture document that describes the way in looks at formatting 
a document. It also describes the in input language, the in3 intermediate language
and what in does or doesn't do. In general, the real formatting is left to the
output-processor (either the formatting of the web page or Groff).

I do not follow all the priciples of 'clean code'. Thinking about how it
shoudld be written has however made my code much more maintanable.
