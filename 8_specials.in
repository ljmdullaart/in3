.h2 Russian text

Можешь писать по русски.
To use Russian cyrilic characters in PDFs, you must first add
a cyrillic font to your groff setup.
This is not well documented and will probably take hours to research
until you find the perfect set-up. The archive
.link add_russian.tgz add_russian.tgz
contains everything I used, including a set-up script. However,
be warned: the 
.fix install.sh
works in MY environment and may need a little tweaking for YOUR environment.
