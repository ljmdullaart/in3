.header

.h1 How to look at a document

.h2 Output document

A document consists of a number of pages. A page has the following structure:

.img in_page.png

A page consists of a

-	header, which should be static
-	a set of alineas that provide the actual content
-	a foot note section, which is specific for that page
-	a footer, which should be static as well.

Headers and footers should be static, because in some output formats (f.e. HTML),
they are printed only once.

An alinea consists of three parts:

-	a left-note part
-	the alinea body
-	the side-note part.

A header (chapter title etc.) is also seen as a specific alinea. For some alineas,
the left or side note section may be empty, either because no content is produced,
or by definition.

.h2 How notes work
Left and side notes follow a different pattern.

.h3 Left notes
Left notes appear as a column on the right of the text. The column for left notes starts
at the first alinea that uses a left note and the column ends at:

-	a .back request
-	a header (at any level)

A .back request does not break the alinea.

A left note is a simple blurb of text, just A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and possibly a space.

In in3, if a left note column is present, it must be specified, even if the left note
part for that alinea is empty.


.h3 Side notes
A column on the right is reserved if anywhere in the text a side note is requested. 

In in3, if a side note column is present, all alineas must specify the side note part.

.h2 Constructs

In and in3 use constructs to create a document. Constructs may be stand-alone or embedded.
Constructs that are exclusively stand-alone cannot be embedded (duh), but they can 
have other contructs emedded. Construct that
can be embedded cannot have other constructs embedded.

	construct	standalone	embedded	can have	comment
	alinea	X	-	X	
	header	X	-	-
	block	X	X	-
	image	X	X	-

Note that for a block, the format can be 'inline'. An inline block cannot be stand alone.
