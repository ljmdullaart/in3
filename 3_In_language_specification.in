.h2 Variables

The concept of variables is used to control the behaviour of the in-scripts. Variables may be
set globally or from a point in the text. If a variable is set as global, the last value in the
input file is used from the beginning. Global variables may be overridden by set requests.


Variables have consequences.

	interpret	global	0=only accented characters<br>1=%% style interpretation<br>2=direct interpretation
	notes	direct	0=no left or side notes<br>1=only leftnotes<br>2=only sidenotes<br>3=both
	H1	direct	Number for the next chapter
	H2	direct	Number for the next section
	H3	direct	Number for the next paragraph
	H4	direct	Number for the next sub-paragraph
	markdown	direct	if 1, accept markdown format requests, 0=don't
	inlineemp	direct	1=accept underscore underlining, star bolding and markdown links; 0=don't

Variables may have initial values

	variable	initial value
	interpret	1
	H1	if the filename starts with a number and an underscore, the value of that number (e.g. 3_title: H1=3)
	markdown	0, but if -m is given: 1
	inlineemp	1
