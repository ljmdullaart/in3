.h1 In language specification
.h2 Special Characters

Some characters have a special meaning.

	*Character*	*When*	*Meaning*
	{tab}	always	Tab is an indication that a format construct (leftnote, table or list) is used
	..	beginning of line	A dot at the beginning of a line indicates a request
	%	when interpret=2	Next characters are interpreted
	 -	beginning of line or after tab(s)	list item in a dash-list
	 #	beginning of line or after tab(s)	list item in a numbered-list
	 @	beginning of line or after tab(s)	list item in a alpha-list

The translation table for the % translations is the in3charmap.

.h3 Blocks

Tables, maps, images  and lists are defined as block requests. They should start on a new alinea
and end with an alinea (i.e. a blank line).
There are a few block-specific requests.

	pre	none	starts or stops a pre-formatted text
	block	type name	creates a specific block type with a specific name
	block format	formatstring	specifies formats for the block
	block	(without args)	close the block

A block is a set of lines that are handled by an additional program. The output-handlers
should provide a comparable output for HTML, text et cetera, but the format may vary 
wildly.
Output handlers may even crash if the block contents poses an impossible problem
for them. The output handler for text has a problem with anything graphical.

There is some influence on the formatting possible 
with the 
.fix block format
request, but it is up to the output handler to determine whether such a request is
silently ignored or honored. The general format of the format string is a number of
.i variable=value
pairs, separated by spaces. 
Currently implemented is:

	variable	HTML	www	pdf	txt	meaning
	scale=75	x	-	-	-	Scale the output of the block to 75%

The following block types are implemented:

	pre	Acts the same as the pre request.
	gnuplot	The external program gnuplot is used to create an image that is included.
	eqn	The lines are fed through eqn to provide a graphical image.
	texeqn	The lines are passed to LaTex for formatting
	pic	The lines are processed by pic to provide a graphical image.
	music	The lines are passed to Lilypond for music typesetting.
	classxx	The lines are formatted as classxx (with xx the name). See stylesheets.

If the name of the block is missing, there will be some random name, which is
most likely relatively unique.

.h2 Variables

The concept of variables is used to control the behavior of the in-scripts. Variables may be
set globally or from a point in the text. If a variable is set as global, the last value in the
input file is used from the beginning. Global variables may be overridden by set requests.


Variables have consequences.

	*Variable*	*active* 	*Meaning*
	interpret	global	0=only accented characters<br>1=%% style interpretation<br>2=direct interpretation
	notes	direct	0=no left or side notes<br>1=only leftnotes<br>2=only sidenotes<br>3=both
	H1	direct	Number for the next chapter
	H2	direct	Number for the next section
	H3	direct	Number for the next paragraph
	H4	direct	Number for the next sub-paragraph
	markdown	direct	if 1, accept markdown format requests, 0=don't
	inlineemp	direct	1=accept underscore underlining, star bolding and markdown links; 0=don't
	font	next alinea	The next alinea uses the specified font.

Variables may have initial values

	variable	initial value
	interpret	1
	H1	if the file name starts with a number and an underscore, the value of that number (e.g. 3_title: H1=3)
	markdown	0, but if -m is given: 1
	inlineemp	1

.h3 Interpret, markdown and inlineemp

Intrepret does an interpretation of character combinations. The character translations are governed by
character maps in
.fix /usr/local/share.
The character maps are also used to translate non-asii characters to the different output channels.
This means that the translation is done by
.fix in4html
and
.fix in3tbl
(the second pass).
	% argument	translation
	8x	%8x
	8X	%8X
	phone	%phone
	plane	%plane
	mail	%mail
	write	%write
	pen	%pen
	check	%check
	CHECK	%CHECK
	wrong	%wrong
	WRONG	%WRONG
	cross	%cross
	CROSS	%CROSS
	david	%david
	star	%star
	snow	%snow


Enthusiastic markdown users would like to use mark-down syntax. The following requests 
are implemented. Inlineemp allows a subset of markdown to be used.

	*markdown* *format* *request*	*allowed* *when*
	use of _ or * emphasis	markdown=1 or inlineemp=1
	use of [] links	markdown=1 or inlineemp=1
	use of > instead of .pre	markdown=1
	==== for chapters	markdown=1
	---- for sections	markdown=1
	hashes for titles	markdown=1
	lists with 1. or a.	markdown=1

.h3 Notes

Notes allows you to change the notes-style. 
You may be tempted to do so, but most of the times, it is unnecessary and a bad idea.

.h3 H1, H2 etc.

These are the chapter numbers. Chapter numbers can be set in different ways:

- via -c on the command line of
.fix in3
- via the 1_-prefix on the filename (1 for chapter number 1 etc.)
- via
.fix set H1 2

This also  makes it possible to, for example, skip paragraph numbers to confuse the readers.

.h3 font

Font allows you to specify the font for the next alinea. Font is changed back to
.fix none
at the end of the alinea. Font changes are implemented differently for the different
output processors.

.fix in3tbl
will change the font to 1 if the font is times, 6 if the font is courier, or to the named
font otherwise. 

.fix in3html
will change the style of the alinea to alinea<fontname>, for example, alineatimes, alineaheletica
etc. It is up to the css to select the correct font and its alternatives.
